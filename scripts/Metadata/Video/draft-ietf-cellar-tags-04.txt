1.  Introduction

   Matroska aims to become THE standard of multimedia container formats.
   It can store timestamped multimedia data but also chapters and tags.
   The "Tag Elements" add important metadata to identify and classify
   the information found in a "Matroska Segment".  It can tag a whole
   "Segment", separate "Track Elements", individual "Chapter Elements"
   or "Attachment Elements".

   While the Matroska tagging framework allows anyone to create their
   own custom tags, it's important to have a common set of values for
   interoperability.  This document intends to define a set of common
   tag names used in Matroska.

Internet-Draft                Matroska Tags                   April 2020


2.  Status of this document

   This document is a work-in-progress specification defining the
   Matroska file format as part of the IETF Cellar working group
   (https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/cellar/charter/).  It uses basic
   elements and concepts already defined in the Matroska specifications
   defined by this workgroup.

3.  Security Considerations

   "Tag" values can be either strings or binary blobs.  This document
   inherits security considerations from the EBML and Matroska
   documents.

4.  IANA Considerations

   To be determined.

5.  Notations and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

6.  Tagging

   When a Tag is nested within another Tag, the nested Tag becomes an
   attribute of the base tag.  For instance, if you wanted to store the
   dates that a singer used certain addresses for, that singer being the
   lead singer for a track that included multiple bands simultaneously,
   then your tag tree would look something like this:

   *  Targets

      -  TrackUID

   *  BAND

      -  LEADPERFORMER

      -  ADDRESS

         o  DATE

         o  DATEEND

Internet-Draft                Matroska Tags                   April 2020


      -  ADDRESS

         o  DATE

   In this way, it becomes possible to store any Tag as attributes of
   another tag.

   Multiple items SHOULD never be stored as a list in a single
   TagString.  If there is more than one tag of a certain type to be
   stored, then more than one SimpleTag SHOULD be used.

   For authoring Tags outside of EBML, the following XML syntax is
   proposed (http://www.matroska.org/files/tags/matroskatags.dtd) used
   in mkvmerge (http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/doc/
   mkvmerge.html#mkvmerge.tags).  Binary data SHOULD be stored using
   BASE64 encoding if it is being stored at authoring time.

6.1.  Why official tags matter

   There is a debate between people who think all tags SHOULD be free
   and those who think all tags SHOULD be strict.  If you look at this
   page you will realize we are in between.

   Advanced-users application might let you put any tag in your file.
   But for the rest of the applications, they usually give you a basic
   list of tags you can use.  Both have their needs.  But it's usually a
   bad idea to use custom/exotic tags because you will probably be the
   only person to use this information even though everyone else could
   benefit from it.  So hopefully when someone wants to put information
   in one's file, they will find an official one that fit them and
   hopefully use it ! If it's not in the list, this person can contact
   us any time for addition of such a missing tag.  But it doesn't mean
   it will be accepted... Matroska files are not meant the become a
   whole database of people who made costumes for a film.  A website
   would be better for that... It's hard to define what SHOULD be in and
   what doesn't make sense in a file.  So we'll treat each request
   carefully.

   We also need an official list simply for developers to be able to
   display relevant information in their own design (if they choose to
   support a list of meta-information they SHOULD know which tag has the
   wanted meaning so that other apps could understand the same meaning).

6.2.  Tag translations

   To be able to save tags from other systems to Matroska we need to
   translate them to our system.  There is a translation table on our
   site (othertagsystems/comparetable.html).

Internet-Draft                Matroska Tags                   April 2020


6.3.  Tag Formatting

   *  The TagName SHOULD always be written in all capital letters and
      contain no space.

   *  The fields with dates SHOULD have the following format: YYYY-MM-DD
      hh:mm:ss.mss YYYY = Year, MM = Month, DD = Days, HH = Hours, mm =
      Minutes, ss = Seconds, mss = Milliseconds.  To store less
      accuracy, you remove items starting from the right.  To store only
      the year, you would use, "2004".  To store a specific day such as
      May 1st, 2003, you would use "2003-05-01".

   *  Fields that require a Float SHOULD use the "." mark instead of the
      "," mark.  To display it differently for another local,
      applications SHOULD support auto replacement on display.  Also, a
      thousandths separator SHOULD NOT be used.

   *  For currency amounts, there SHOULD only be a numeric value in the
      Tag. Only numbers, no letters or symbols other than ".".  For
      instance, you would store "15.59" instead of "$15.59USD".

6.4.  Target types

   The TargetType element allows tagging of different parts that are
   inside or outside a given file.  For example in an audio file with
   one song you could have information about the album it comes from and
   even the CD set even if it's not found in the file.

   For application to know what kind of information (like TITLE) relates
   to a certain level (CD title or track title), we also need a set of
   official TargetType names.  For now audio and video will have
   different values & names.  That also means the same tag name can have
   different meanings depending on where it is (otherwise we would end
   up with 15 TITLE_ tags).

   An upper level value tag applies to the lower level.  That means if a
   CD has the same artist for all tracks, you just need to set the
   ARTIST tag at level 50 (ALBUM) and not to each TRACK (but you can).
   That also means that if some parts of the CD have no known ARTIST the
   value MUST be set to nothing (a void string "").

   When a level doesn't exist it MUST NOT be specified in the files, so
   that the TOTAL_PARTS and PART_NUMBER elements match the same levels.

   Here is an example of how these "organizational" tags work: If you
   set 10 TOTAL_PARTS to the ALBUM level (40) it means the album
   contains 10 lower parts.  The lower part in question is the first
   lower level that is specified in the file.  So if it's TRACK (30)
   then that means it contains 10 tracks.  If it's MOVEMENT (20) that
   means it's 10 movements, etc.

6.5.  Official tags

   The following is a complete list of the supported Matroska Tags.
   While it is possible to use Tag names that are not listed below, this
   is not recommended as compatibility will be compromised.  If you find
   that there is a Tag missing that you would like to use, then please
   contact the Matroska team for its inclusion in the specifications
   before the format reaches 1.0.

6.6.  Nesting Information

   Nesting Information tags are intended to contain other tags.

    | MEASURE          | UTF-8  | In music, a measure is a unit of    |
    |                  |        | time in Western music like "4/4".   |
    |                  |        | It represents a regular grouping of |
    |                  |        | beats, a meter, as indicated in     |

    |                  |        | hear on the radio these days is     |
    |                  |        | written in the 4/4 time signature.  |

    |                  |        | to allow near-perfect tuning of     |
    |                  |        | instruments to the same tone as the |
    |                  |        | musical piece (e.g. "441.34" in     |
    |                  |        | Hertz).  The default value is 440.0 |
    |                  |        | Hz.                                 |
